# Transitrix Studio — examples

One subfolder per diagram format. Open any example file in VS Code with the Transitrix Studio extension installed to see a live preview.

| Folder | File extension | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`bpmn/`](bpmn/) | `*.bpmn.yaml` | BPMN | Business process diagrams with lanes, gateways, and flows |
| [`goals/`](goals/) | `*.goals.transitrix.yaml` | Goals tree | Hierarchical goal decomposition (Strategy → Business Goal → Project) |
| [`fgca/`](fgca/) | `*.fgca.transitrix.yaml` | FGCA | Factor → Goal → Change → Activity chain |
| [`fga/`](fga/) | `*.fga.transitrix.yaml` | FGA | Factor → Goal → Activity (FGCA without Changes) |
| [`activities/`](activities/) | `*.activities.transitrix.yaml` | Activity network | AoN / PSND precedence diagram with critical path |
| [`blocks/`](blocks/) | `*.blocks.transitrix.txt` | Nested block diagrams | ASCII art architecture maps rendered via svgbob |

Each folder contains a `README.md` with format documentation and the list of example files.

## Quick start

1. Install the **Transitrix Studio** extension in VS Code.
2. Open any example file — the preview panel opens automatically beside the editor.
3. Edit and save the file to refresh the preview.

## Notes on nested-blocks/

The `nested-blocks/` folder is a legacy location kept for reference.
New blocks examples belong in `blocks/`.

For how `examples/` fits into the broader repo layout, see [`docs/repo-layout.md`](../docs/repo-layout.md).

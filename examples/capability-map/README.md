# Capability Map notation — examples

File extension: **`.capability-map.transitrix.yaml`**

## Format overview

A capability map is a hierarchical view of what an organisation can do (its capabilities) and how mature each capability is on the CMMI V2.0 1–5 scale. Vertical capabilities (`V1`, `V1.1`, …) are core business domains; horizontal capabilities (`H1`, `H1.2`, …) cut across domains (master data management, compliance, ESG).

## Files in this folder

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [`business.capability-map.transitrix.yaml`](business.capability-map.transitrix.yaml) | Compact three-domain business map with cross-cutting H capabilities and nested levels |
| [`northbay-retail.capability-map.transitrix.yaml`](northbay-retail.capability-map.transitrix.yaml) | Realistic 31-capability map for a mid-size retailer (three verticals × three levels, three horizontals) |

## Notation header

Every file must start with:

```yaml
notation: capability-map
```

## Required fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `capability_map.id` | Unique identifier for this map |
| `capability_map.name` | Display name |
| `capability_map.assessment_date` | Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format |
| `capabilities[].id` | Pattern `V[n]` or `H[n]` with optional `.n` segments — unique across the tree |
| `capabilities[].name` | Capability name |
| `capabilities[].current_maturity` | Integer 1–5 (CMMI level) |

## Optional fields per capability

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `type` | `domain` or `supporting` |
| `description` | Short description |
| `target_maturity` | Integer 1–5 |
| `target_date` | Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `owner_role` | Responsible role |
| `business_process` | Process ID this capability is realised by |
| `applications` | List of supporting application IDs |
| `children` | List of sub-capabilities (same shape, recursive) |

| 3 | Defined | yellow |
| 4 | Quantitatively Managed | light green |
| 5 | Optimising | green |

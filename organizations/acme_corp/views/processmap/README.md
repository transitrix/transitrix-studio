# `canon/views/processmap/`

Process landscape maps — a top-level catalogue of the organisation's processes, grouped by Operating / Supporting / Management. Each process referenced here resolves to a BusinessProcess element under `canon/elements/02_business/processes/`. Detailed flow diagrams (BPMN) live in `canon/views/bpmn/`.

`process_id`, `owner_role`, and `capability` hold **element / capability IDs**, not display names.

`valid_from` / `valid_to` are required on every inline process entry per [`notations/CONTRACT.md`](../../../../../notations/CONTRACT.md) §7 and are distinct from the per-process `status` (`Draft` / `Active` / `Deprecated`) which is an operational state. Process groups (`groups[]`) are organisational containers, not elements, and carry no lifecycle of their own; the process-map document itself carries none either.

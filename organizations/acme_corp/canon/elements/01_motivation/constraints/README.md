# `canon/elements/01_motivation/constraints/`

Constraint elements — design / operating constraints that bind the organisation. Each constraint is one file under this folder. Constraints sit on the ArchiMate 3.2 **motivation** layer.

Constraints are referenced by FGCA factors via `references_constraint:` — the existence of a constraint is itself a factor for the organisation that acts on it. They may also be referenced from any other notation via `applies_to:` once a register-view notation lands; v1 ships the elements only.

TYPE registry: see [`notations/IDS_AND_REFERENCES.md`](../../../../../../notations/IDS_AND_REFERENCES.md) §3.1 (`CONSTRAINT`).

## File convention

`<id>.yaml`, where `<id>` follows the canonical grammar `CONSTRAINT-[<middle>-]<INTEGER>` from `IDS_AND_REFERENCES.md`.

Examples: `CONSTRAINT-GDPR-1.yaml`, `CONSTRAINT-1.yaml`.

## Element schema

The schema is shared between `RULE` and `CONSTRAINT` elements — `notation` (plus the ID prefix and folder placement) distinguishes them; folder placement mirrors the ArchiMate layer. See the common envelope in [`notations/ELEMENT_PRIMITIVES.md`](../../../../../../notations/ELEMENT_PRIMITIVES.md) §3 and the CONSTRAINT field set in §7.13.

### Required

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `notation` | literal `constraint` |
| `id` | `CONSTRAINT-[<middle>-]<INTEGER>` |
| `name` | one-line statement |
| `statement` | normative wording — `MUST` / `SHOULD` / `MUST NOT` recommended |
| `status` | one of `active` / `proposed` / `deprecated` / `retired` |
| admission record | `zone: canon`, `admitted_at`, `admitted_by`, `gate_checks` — [`CONTRACT.md`](../../../../../../notations/CONTRACT.md) §6 |
| lifecycle | `valid_from`, `valid_to` — [`CONTRACT.md`](../../../../../../notations/CONTRACT.md) §7 |

### Optional

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `applies_to` | array of typed IDs the constraint binds. v1 accepts **any registered TYPE** from `IDS_AND_REFERENCES.md`; the validator checks the TYPE prefix is in the registry. Cross-document resolution is out of scope. |
| `source` | citation — regulation, contract, decision reference |
| `owner_role` | `ROLE-…` ID accountable for the constraint |
| `severity` | one of `mandatory` / `recommended` / `advisory` |
| `rationale` | why this constraint exists (regulatory / strategic / contractual context) |

## Skeleton

```yaml
notation: constraint
id: CONSTRAINT-SAMPLE-1
name: "Short one-line statement"
statement: "MUST / SHOULD / MUST NOT wording, single sentence."
status: active

# Optional fields
applies_to: []            # e.g. [PROCESS-ORDER-1, APPLICATION-OMS-1]
source: "Regulation §X.Y / Contract §Z"
owner_role: ROLE-OWNER-1
severity: mandatory       # mandatory | recommended | advisory
rationale: "Why this constraint exists in the organisation."

# Admission record (CONTRACT.md §6)
zone: canon
admitted_at: "2026-05-29"
admitted_by: "firstname.lastname"
gate_checks:
  uniqueness: pass
  consistency: pass
  completeness: pass

# Primitive lifecycle (CONTRACT.md §7)
valid_from: "2018-05-25"
valid_to: null
```

# `canon/views/applications/`

Applications catalogue — a curated catalogue of the applications and integrations in operation. Each entry references an Application element under `canon/elements/03_application/applications/` and carries the display attributes used to render the catalogue.

## File convention

`*.applications.transitrix.yaml`

## Skeleton

```yaml

      valid_from: "2026-05-26"          # CONTRACT.md §7 — required on every inline applications-catalogue entry, regardless of `type`; distinct from operational `status`
      valid_to: null

    - app_id: "APPLICATION-CRM-1"
      name: "CRM System"
      type: "application"
      domain: "Sales"
      owner_role: "ROLE-SALES-1"
      vendor: "Salesforce"
      status: "Active"

```

`capabilities` and `products` hold **element IDs**, not display names. Integrations may be inlined (as above) or modelled as their own `type: integration` entries.

`valid_from` / `valid_to` are required on every inline applications-catalogue entry per [`notations/CONTRACT.md`](../../../../../notations/CONTRACT.md) §7, regardless of `type` (`application` / `integration` / `platform` / `data_store`). They are distinct from the per-entry `status` field (operational state). Per-application nested `integrations[]` descriptors share the parent's lifecycle and carry no `valid_from` / `valid_to` of their own; when an integration is promoted to a top-level `type: integration` entry, it becomes a first-class lifecycle-bearing element with its own dates.

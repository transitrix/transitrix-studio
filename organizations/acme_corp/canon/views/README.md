# `canon/views/`

Composite diagrams and aggregations over architecture elements. Atomic ArchiMate elements live in `canon/elements/<layer>/`; everything that aggregates, filters, or visualises elements lives here.

See [`method/methodology.md` §6](../../../method/methodology.md) for the full notation kit and rationale.

## Naming

File names use `kebab-case` or descriptive `[DOMAIN]-[CONTEXT]` prefixes. Examples:

```
canon/views/goals/strategy-2026.dgca.transitrix.yaml
canon/views/capabilities/customer-domain.capability-map.transitrix.yaml
canon/views/bpmn/order-fulfillment.bpmn.transitrix.yaml
canon/views/fgca/eu-expansion.fgca.transitrix.yaml
canon/views/products/active-portfolio.products.transitrix.yaml
```

## What does NOT go here

Atomic elements — Goals, Capabilities, BusinessProcesses (thin metadata files), Products, ApplicationComponents, etc. — stay in `canon/elements/<layer>/`. The view in `canon/views/products/` is a *filter expression* over many Product elements, each of which lives in `canon/elements/02_business/<id>.yaml`.
